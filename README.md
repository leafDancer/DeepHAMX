## Dependencies
* Quick installation of conda environment for Python: ``conda env create -f environment.yml``
* For JAX version setup instructions, please refer to: [`srcx/README.md`](./srcx/README.md)
## Running
### Quick start for the Krusell-Smith (KS) model under default configs:
To use DeepHAM to solve the competitive equilibrium of the KS model, run
```
python train_KS.py
```
To evaluate the Bellman error of the solution of the KS model, run
```
python validate_KS.py
```

Sample scripts for solving the KS model in the Slurm system are provided in the folder ``src/slurm_scripts``

### Solve the model in Fernandez-Villaverde, Hurtado, and Nuno (2019):
```
python train_JFV.py
```
```
python validate_JFV.py
```
Details on the model setup and algorithm can be found in our paper.
